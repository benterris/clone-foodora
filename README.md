# MyFoodora

MyFoodora is a command line application that manages food delivery, like Foodora or Deliveroo.
This is a Java application I made as a project for school.

## Features

Although in command line, this app is full of features, among which :

- Different kind of users : customers, restaurants, couriers, managers
- Complete account management : login, personnal info...
- In-app full control for managers : account creation, deletion, moderation...
- Ability for restaurants to create meals, menus, special discount and freely chose their business plan
- Customers can build up their orders, subscribe to mail notifications when a new discount is created in their favourite restaurant...
- Couriers can receive new missions, see their saved deliveries and amount of money earned
- The manager can chose one among several different algorithms for courier allocation (least active, closest to the destination...)
- Various fidelity cards plans the restaurants can chose to give their customers : cumulative points, random reductions...
- Handy monitoring functionnalities likes long-term or short-term profit calculations, business plan calculations (best service fee or markup percentage to meet target profit, etc.)

## Installation

You just have to run `src/myfoodora/CommandLineUserInterface.java`
